Hey Cabinet!

So we have an email list that people can add and remove themselves without us doing it manually.  

Please check out the website on our site that explains it and how it works.

How to send emails!
  To send an email to the email list, the body of the email must contain the following two lines:
"APPROVED:hdub
"
with the second line being blank.

So a "test" email would look like this...

To: dubh@iastate.edu
Subject: Test
Body:
APPROVED:hdub

Test email!
Barret

The people on the email list would receive an email looking like...
To: dubh@iastate.edu
Subject: Test
Body:
Test email!
Barret


Enjoy!!!

Best,
Barret Schloerke
